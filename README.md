CasperMachineMigrator
=====================

If you are replacing a user's Mac or doing a larger hardware refresh, this is a tool to migrate the static inventory information of one Mac JSS record to another.

**Please Note:** Please test thoroughly before using in your own environment! Amsys will accept no responsibility for loss or damage caused by this script.

This script can migrate all text field Extension Attributes, drop-down menu Extension Attributes and user and location information from one JSS computer record to another.  The script can be run on a single line to move one record to another:

	./CasperMachineMigrator -v -s Amsys-123 -d Amsys-321 -c https://jss.amsys.co.uk:8443 -u darren -p 'password'

It can also be used with a tab delimited file to migrate the data for multiple records at once

	./CasperMachineMigrator -v -c https://jss.amsys.co.uk:8443 -u darren -p 'password' -f /Users/Shared/TabFile

Notes:

- Static group assignments aren't currently migrated (this is on the to-do list)
- Script populated EAs aren't migrated as they are dynamically generated during inventory collections
- If more than one result is found for either the source or destination computer, the script will exit

Running the script with no options will display the below help information:

	Usage: $0 [-v] -s SourceComputer [-h] [-d DestinationComputer] [-c CasperURL] [-u APIUsername] [-p APIPassword | -P] [-n] [-f PathToFile]
	
	-v						Verbose mode. Output all the things
	-s SourceComputer		Supply an identifier to use as the source of the information.

	-d DestinationComputer 	Supply an identifier to use as the destination of the information to import the source computer's details into.
	-c CasperURL			Supply the Casper URL to contact for the work. if not specified, then the default set
