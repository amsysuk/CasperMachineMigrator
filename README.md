CasperMachineMigrator
=====================

If you are replacing a user's Mac or doing a larger hardware refresh, this is a tool to migrate the static inventory information of one Mac JSS record to another.

This script can migrate all text field Extension Attributes, drop-down menu Extension Attributes and user and location information from one JSS computer record to another.  The script can be run on a single line to move one record to another:

	./CasperMachineMigrator -v -s Amsys-123 -d Amsys-321 -c https://jss.amsys.co.uk:8443 -u darren -p password

It can also be used with a tab delimited file to migrate the data for multiple records at once

	./CasperMachineMigrator -v -c https://jss.amsys.co.uk:8443 -u darren -p password -f /Users/Shared/TabFile

Notes:

- Static group assignments aren't currently migrated (this is on the to-do list)
- Script populated EAs aren't migrated as they are dynamically generated during inventory collections

Running the script with no options will display the below help information:
